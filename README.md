# OCR_NEURAL_NETWORK
Trained a simple Optical Character Recognizer(OCR) model to identify the text from an image using Neural Network

# To train an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model to identify text from an image, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Collect a dataset of images that contain text. You can use the sample images you have provided as well as additional images that you scrape from the internet. Make sure to vary the type, size, and font of the text in the images to create a diverse and representative dataset.

2. Preprocess the images in the dataset. This may include resizing the images to a uniform size, converting the images to grayscale, and applying image filters to enhance the contrast of the text in the images.

3. Split the dataset into training and test sets. You will use the training set to train your OCR model, and the test set to evaluate the performance of the model.

4. Train a machine learning model to recognize the text in the images. You can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) or another type of deep learning model for this task. Make sure to use appropriate techniques such as data augmentation and regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

5. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set. This will give you an idea of how well the model can recognize text in new, unseen images.

6. Fine-tune the model as needed based on the results of the evaluation. You may need to adjust the model architecture, the training hyperparameters, or the preprocessing steps to improve the performance of the model.




## Hosted / Deployed the project  using Streamlit 

Streamlit Cloud lets you deploy your apps in just one click, and most apps will deploy in only a few minutes.



## Data collection : 

Used publicly available data: There are many publicly available datasets that you can use to train an OCR model, such as the COCO-Text dataset of natural images, the SVT dataset of scanned documents, or the OCR dataset from the French National Library. These datasets may be more specialized or targeted towards specific OCR tasks, and they can be a good resource for training models for these tasks.

Scrape data from the web: You can use web scraping tools to collect images of text from websites or other online sources
